# TODO

- ~~improve loading wait experience by revealing terminal/debug logs in some way~~
- ~~render in images one by one as they process (grayscale + physics render)~~
- ~~add favicon~~
- ~~change grayscaling to prefer white to black~~
- change process flow to greyscale all images and then run the processing
- change ddl of algos to a set of checkboxes to allow multiple algos to run together (select all be default)
- when algos run present each algo as a new row (run all greyscale, all algo 1, all algo 2, etc) and render them in one by one in rows

- find/create an actually good algorithm

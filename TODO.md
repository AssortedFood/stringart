# TODO

- ~~improve loading wait experience by revealing terminal/debug logs in some way~~
- ~~render in images one by one as they process (grayscale + physics render)~~
- ~~add favicon~~
- ~~change grayscaling to prefer white to black~~
- ~~change process flow to greyscale all images and then run the processing~~
- ~~change ddl of algos to a set of checkboxes to allow multiple algos to run together (select all be default)~~
- ~~when algos run present each algo as a new row (run all greyscale, all algo 1, all algo 2, etc) and render them in one by one in rows~~
- when all images are rendered theres a weird "reload" that happens that hides everything and snaps it all back in at the end
- ~~vectors collapse should open with a width the same size as the image in its column~~
    - ~~it should open a scrollable box and the vectors should be separated onto new lines~~

- find/create an actually good algorithm

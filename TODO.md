# TODO

- ~~handle user leaving page/restarting process UX~~
- ~~move vector and node vars to the UI~~
- ~~update DEBUG text to present more information during processing~~
- ~~refactor from DEBUG to SSE~~
- ~~change greyscale interpretting transparent -> black to white~~
- ~~ensure that node and string UI values are actually tied to file variables~~
    - ~~number of strings should be MAX number of strings (algos are allowed to use less)~~
- ~~ensure that threading is not causing algos to run simultaneously, rather speed up each algo in sequence~~
- update the physics renderer
    - should live draw the node to node vectors
- remove the less promising algorithms
- add the algorithm from [Michael Crum's Generalized String Art Generator](https://michael-crum.com/string_art_generator/)
